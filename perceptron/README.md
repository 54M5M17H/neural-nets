# The Perceptron


### What is it?
A perceptron, replicating the acition of a single neuron in an artificial Neural Network,
trained using the supervised learning method. You can watch as it learns.

### How does it work?
The perceptron takes given coordinates `[x, y]`, and guesses whether the point is above or below the unknown line.
Threw error feedback typical of a supervised learning approach, the perceptron can solve for any linear equation
(`y = mx + c`).

### What is it used for?
A perceptron can solve any linearly seperable problem (anything which can be divided with one straight line).
This is applicable to the general categorisation tasks for which Neural Networks have proven themselves so useful.
